This is just a copy of my 'to-do list' for the RetroPie Raspberry Pi project.

I created this for my brother as a gift for his university graduation a few years ago. 

The Raspberry Pi 3B+ was powerful enough to emulate everything up to the N64 / PS1. Some titles on those consoles were playable, but it some definitely weren't. 

Seeing as the Raspberry Pi 4 is a pretty hefty upgrade in the performance department, I would guess that it allows you to play most PS1 / N64 games as well. Especially the 4gb RAM variant.
